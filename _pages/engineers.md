## ðŸ”§ Technical Deep Dives

This is where we get into the nitty-gritty details that matter when you're building ML systems. 

**What you'll find here:**
- Reproducible experiments with full code
- Performance benchmarks and comparisons  
- Architecture breakdowns of real systems
- Debugging stories and lessons learned
- Scaling challenges and solutions

**Recent topics I'm exploring:**
- Fine-tuning efficiency techniques for resource-constrained environments
- Production inference optimization strategies
- Building robust evaluation pipelines

Every post includes runnable code, detailed methodology, and honest assessments of what works (and what doesn't) in practice.
