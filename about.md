Iâ€™m a self-made Machine Learning Engineer with a background in **economics and law** and 4+ years of industry experience.  

Iâ€™ve published at **NeurIPS** (including a best paper award) and worked on datasets, large-scale training, and applied ML systems.  

This blog shares two perspectives:  
- **Research Engineering notes** for fellow ML engineers.  
- **Accessible explainers** for anyone curious about how ML shapes our world.
